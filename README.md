## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

#### The intercept, vehicle_length, and ground_clearance coeeficients are variables/coefficients with a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values.
#### At 0.05, the slope of the linear model is not zero. 
#### With the R-square of 0.6825 the linear model predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes are effective. 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

#### The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. As such, the current manufacturing data does meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total. However not in the individual lot.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
#### Perhaps another linear regression to consider is gas mileage city vs highway. In terms of metrics... city and highway fuel efficiency - dependent variable, cylinder count - independent variable, car weight - independent variable. Fule efficiency and cylinder count are missing from the data set.
